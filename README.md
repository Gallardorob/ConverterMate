# ConverterMate
Unit Conversion mobile application created using Flutter framework and Dart language.<br>
This application was created as school project. I created a mobile application that converts various unit measurements such as length, mass, volume, and temperature. The application uses an API to convert the userâ€™s input into the conversion that they selected. The user can select their preferred measurement using a dropdown button from the app bar.
